Hi there!

Welcome to my personal portfolio. 

This portfolio is built on Jekyll and the theme is mostly inspired from a theme called Simplygrey. All credits go to the author of that theme of course. During the next couple of weeks i hope to put up some of my projects here and write a line or two about them. 

Until then however you can check them out on my Github. Just click the link on the left to go there.

Other then that i don't have much more to say. Stay tuned!

/Carl
