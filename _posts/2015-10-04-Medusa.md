Medusa was a project developed for our bachelor thesis at Link√∂pings University. Me and a group consisting of 6 other members developed a 3D scanning booth. The goal of the project was to be able to scan a person and retrieve a 3D model afterwards which could be printed in a 3D printer for example

The hardware used was a first generation Kinect camera from Microsoft. To utilizie this we wrote code using libraries such as OpenKinect, OpenCV and libwebsockets. The interface for handling the system was a simple website which connected to the program through a websocket connection.

Code for the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/tistatos/Medusa">here</a>.
If you're interested in reading more about the techniques used to retrieve 3D-models from a Kinect our report can be read<a href="https://github.com/tistatos/Medusa/blob/develop/rapport/rapport.pdf"> here</a>. The report is in swedish though.

The picture below shows some of the first tests reconstructing a person with cloud point data retrieved from the Kinect.
