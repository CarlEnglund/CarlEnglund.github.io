The SSS or as it says in the title, Stereoscopic Snow Simulation is a project that was done during the spring of 2014.

It was a project in the course TNM061 - 3-D Computer Graphics taken at Linköpings University and we decided to build a 3-D visualization for the dome theatre here in Norrköping.

The result was a snow simulation adopted for usage in the dome. It was developed in C++ using OpenGL and a library called SGCT (Simple Graphics Cluster Toolkit). 

A sneak peak can be shown in the picture below.
The code can be viewed at https://github.com/tistatos/TNM061-StereoSnowSim.
